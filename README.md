# MikeBot
MikeBot is a multipurpose discord bot which has a mix of fun features and administration features. Although MikeBot doesn't have many features at the moment you can still invite the bot through [the website](https://wombat24455.github.io/mikebot.github.io/) or [directly](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=639421464185143301&scope=bot&permissions=2146958847). I have made the repository public as there is no sensitive information within the files and so you can actually read this.
